# array.cpp

Function practice cenetered around arrays of strings in C++
Use main to run tests!

Guide:
enumerate
- returns the amount of times the target string appears in the array
- searches from element 0 to n

findMatch
- returns the position of the first instance of the target string 

findRun
- returns true if the target string appears more than once consecutively 
- returns false if the target string doesn't appear or only appears once consecutively 
- leave "begin" and "end" variables undeclared in main

findMin
- returns the position of the smallest (alphabetical) element of the array 

moveToEnd
- moves the string at position "pos" to the end of the array
- returns the original position of the string 

moveToBeginning
- moves the string at position "pos" to the beginning of the array
- returns the original position of the string 

findDifference
- returns the position that two arrays differ 

removeDups
- removes an element of the array if it's a duplicate 
- returns the amount of elements after the duplicates are removed 

subsequence
- checks if array2 is a subsequence of array1 (every element of array2 is contained in array1, consecutively)
- returns true if subsequence is found, false if not

makeMerger
- merges two arrays into a third array, then sorts the elements to be in alphabetical order 
- returns the number of elements in the resulting array
